# Planning

## Gather info and organize your remix

Create a table (using Excel) that contains the following info: new book title, new chapter numbers and titles, new section numbers and titles, source section numbers and titles, source book.

# Building Remix

## Create an account and log in

- [Contact LibreTexts](mailto:info@libretexts.org) to request an instructor account in a specific library

- Go the the LibreTexts library that you have an instructor account and log in.
  ![Log in LibreTexts Library](img/LoginPage.png){fig-align="center"}

## Locate the remixer

The Remixer can be found in `Tools` on the left side navigation panel.

![Locate Remixer in Tools](img/LocationRemixer.png){fig-align="center"}

## Set remixer options

Enter the title and choose remixer option(s). The default option works fine.

![Set Remixer Options](img/RemixerOptions.png){fig-align="center"}

## Locate source contents

You may choose contents that you will use for all libraries of LibreTexts.

![Library Panel](img/LibraryPanel.png){fig-align="center"}

## Create a remix map

A remix map can be created by dragging sections/chapters from the library panel to dropping them to the remixer panel. Chapter and section titles can be renamed by double clicking them.

![Creating Contents by drag-and-drop](img/CreatingContents.png){fig-align="center"}

## Rearrange and edit

Rearrange can be done by drag-and-drop.  Tools for editing chapters and pages are located right above the remixer panel.

# Edit Published Remix

## Sandbox

Before being moved to a college hub, a published remix can be located in the sandbox of your account.

![Sandbox under account](img/WhereSandbox.png){fig-align="center"}

## Locate the published book

Published books can be found in the personal sandbox.

![Location of personal sandbox in LibreTexts](img/PersonalSandbox.png){fig-align="center"}

## Edit or reremix a book

To edit or reremix a book in the sandbox, go to the remixer and switch it to the `Edit Remix Mode`.

![Edit remix mode](img/EditMode.png){fig-align="center"}

## Find the remixed book to edit or reremix

Once the remixer is in the edit mode, you see the sandbox in the library panel.

![Sandbox in library panel](img/SandboxInLibrary.png){fig-align="center"}

## Select and load the book to the Remixer

A selected book can be loaded to the Remixer by clicking the `REREMIX SELECTION` button.

![](img/LoadToRemixer.png){fig-align="center"}

## Reremix and republish the book

The book can be reremixed and republished as before.

![Reremix and publish](img/ReremixAndPublish.png){fig-align="center"}

## Move the book to a campus hub

To make the remix book public, you need to contact [info@libretexts.org](mailto:info@libretexts.org) to move it to a Campus Hub. If a campus hub doesnot exist, you may ask them to create one.

## Harvest your books

Suppose contents and a skeleton remix map were created. Then you can use copy-and-paste to add contents to pages. See 
“A Harvesting Checklist.” 2020. August 16, 2020. <https://chem.libretexts.org/@go/page/148794> for details.

## OER integration

If you found an OER book that is not available on Libretexts, you may fill out an integration request.

# LMS Integration

## Integrate a book into Blackboard

LibreTexts provides common cartriges for integration into a learning management system (LMS).
